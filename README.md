# InitialState-Desktop-Dashboard
### A desktop companion to our mobile app. Easily view several data feeds without opening your browser!

Many of us internet-of-things lovers have one thing in common...we love to visualize our data! Whether that be utilizing the numerous online dashboard services, or some other homemade concoction.

One of the main services that we love to use on a regular basis is provided by Initial State. They offer some awesome looking dashboard features as well as nice data logging and analytics...the one downside to these services (until now)? **No mobile or desktop applications!** We set out to change that and recently launched two versions of our mobile app on the Google Play Store.

### While our primary goal was to provide a companion app for the Initial State dashboard service on mobile, we also thought it would still be handy to have a desktop version to keep on screen without having to bother with the browser. This is no more true than for applications using smaller microcomputers such as a Raspberry Pi (which we have loads of and really wanted to build this app specifically for)!

**The app uses Material-UI themed React components, all bundled up into a smooth-running Electron-powered application**<img width="1062" alt="Overview Screen" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49820403/128966436-409bdab6-6eca-407d-b61f-2e53cdf7df83.png">

## While this release version is fully functional as-is out of the box, it is by no means complete! More tabs will be added with additional functionality and more feed data...we just wanted to go ahead and share the project with everyone else to provide feedback and even make contributions.


**Note: For the time being, the names of the sensor data feed that your devices send to your dashboard will have to be named as follows for the app to correctly retrieve them:** `LivingRoom-Temperature | LivingRoom-Humidity | Bedroom-Temperature | Bedroom-Humidity`
